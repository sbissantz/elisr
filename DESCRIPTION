Description: elisr implements the Exploratory Likert Scaling approach for 
    metrical data in R. It thus supports the user when exploring 
    multidimensional data structures. In common research practice one usually 
    falls back on Exploratory Factor Analysis. As a side effect researchers 
    often accept rigid model assumptions. By dissolving conjectures like 
    orthogonal factors, elisr provides a platform to improve the identification 
    of relevant dimensions and allows scales to naturally correlate with each 
    other.
