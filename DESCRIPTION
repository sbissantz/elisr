Description: An alternative to exploratory factor analysis for metrical
    data in R. The Exploratory Likert Scaling approach supports the user
    exploring multidimensional data structures. In common research
    practice one usually draws on Exploratory Factor Analysis. As a side
    effect researchers often accept overly rigid model assumptions. By
    dissolving conjectures like orthogonal factors, the package provides a
    platform to improve the identification of relevant dimensions and
    allows scales to naturally correlate with each other.
