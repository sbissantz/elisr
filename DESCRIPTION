Description: The musclr package implements the multiple scaling approach 
    according to the principle of crystallization in R. It thus supports the 
    user when exploring multi-dimensional data structures. In common
    research practice one generally considers explorative factor analysis in 
    this case -- often accepting rigid model assumptions (e.g., pre-determining 
    the number of dimensions, one actually tries to "post explore"). By 
    dissolving model proposed requirments musclr provides a plattform to maximize 
    (a) the identification of theoretically relevant dimensions (to their full 
    extent), (b) enabling the scales to correlate with eachother that they can 
    reflect the actual conditions.
