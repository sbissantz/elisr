Description: An alternative to Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) for
    metrical data in R. Drawing on characteristics of classical test
    theory, Exploratory Likert Scaling (ELiS) supports the user exploring
    multiple one-dimensional data structures. In common research practice,
    however, EFA remains as go-to method to uncover the (underlying)
    structure of a data set. Orthogonal dimensions and the potential of
    overextraction are often accepted as side effects. ELiS confronts
    these problems. As a result, elisr provides the platform to fully
    exploit the exploratory potential of the multiple scaling approach
    itself.
