Description: An alternative to exploratory factor analysis for metrical data in 
    R. The Exploratory Likert Scaling approach supports the user exploring 
    multidimensional data structures. In common research practice one usually 
    draws on Exploratory Factor Analysis. As a side effect researchers 
    often accept overly rigid model assumptions. By dissolving conjectures like 
    orthogonal factors, the package provides a platform to improve the 
    identification of relevant dimensions and allows scales to naturally 
    correlate with each other.
