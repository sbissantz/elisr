Description: The elisr package implements the exploratory likert scaling approach 
    for metrical data in R. It thus supports the user when exploring multi-dimensional data structures. 
    In common research practice one generally considers explorative factor 
    analysis in this case -- often accepting rigid model assumptions (e.g., 
    orthogonality). By dissolving these assumptions musclr provides a platform 
    to maximize (a) the identification of theoretically relevant dimensions 
    (to their full extent), (b) enabling the scales to correlate with one 
    another that they meet the actual conditions.
