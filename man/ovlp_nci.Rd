\title{Multiple Scaling In An Overlapping Manner Using Positive Items}
\usage{
ovlp_nci(muscldf, mrit_min, overlap_with, sclvals, use)
}
\arguments{
\item{muscldf}{a multiple scaled data frame (built with \code{disjoint}).}

\item{mrit_min}{a numerical constant to set the (corrected item total)
correlation. The value of this lower bound must be in the range of 0 to 1.
If no value is entered (\code{NULL}, the default) \code{overlap} tries to
get the one specified in \code{disjoint}, by looking for a \code{mrit_min}
attribute in the given \code{muscldf}.}

\item{overlap_with}{a string telling \code{overlap} which items to start the
scaling process with. One can choose to use either the "core" of each scale
or a "fragment". The default is set to "fragment".}

\item{sclvals}{a numerical vector of length 2 indicating the first and the
full scale value. Consider using the shape \code{c(min,max)}.}

\item{use}{an optional string indicating how to deal with missing values if
necessary. See \code{use} in \code{\link[stats]{cor}} for details.}

\item{negative_too}{a logical constant indicating whether items with a
negative correlation should be included in the scaling process. The default
is set to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
\code{ovlp_nci} is an internal function. It returns a list of
  data frames by taking one (\code{muscldf}). In order to do that,
  \code{ovlp_nci} pre-sets the scales by using either the core items of the
  given multiple scaled data frame or the full scale, i.e. all items of each
  scale (\code{scls}). Furthermore, \code{ovlp_nci} pre-sets a list of scales
  including everything but these items (\code{ebscls}). These steps equal the
  building process (step 1 to 3) in the disjoint scaling procedure. Thus, the
  given scale need to be expanded. Therefore, \code{ovlp_nci} uses each
  component of the second list (\code{ebscls}) on a step by step base. In a
  particular case this happens as follows: While the absolute value of the
  correlation of a remaining item in the scale (with the sum score) is
  greater than the pre-specified lower bound, the scale is enlarged with the
  according item (from \code{ebscls}). After one overlap \code{ovlp_pci}
  moves on to the next scale.
}
\details{
The \code{use} argument takes control over the treatment of missing
  values when correlation matrices are build. In a scaling process this
  happens at least twice: first when determining the core (the two items of
  the correlation matrix with the highest linear relationship), and second
  when an item is considered to be part of this scale.

  Hint: If there ought to be two items in the scaling process, having an
  equal correlation, e.g. with the sum score, always the first one is used.
